                A Personal Assistant is software which is particularly designed
                to meet the needs of the user from personal level to industrial
                level. Almost everyone in this 21st century is accustomed with
                the term Personal Assistant, a piece of UI designed to perform
                tasks ranging from keeping track of events to cracking jokes.
                Such a software agent performs tasks or services for an
                individual based on commands or questions. Some Personal
                Assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond
                via synthesized voices.

                Snowy is a basic personal assistant software, designed to
                meet the day-to-day needs of a user, like remembering
                birthdays, keeping track of meetings and perform basic
                calculations.

                Snowy is going to be a super-duper user-friendly virtual
                assistant that can perform a wide variety of standard tasks in a
                relatively efficient and concise way.

            </p>
            <p> One of many tasks it can perform are :</p>
            <ul class="purplist">
                <li>Keep a track of your meetings</li>
                <li>Keep track of your travels, i.e., flights and railway</li>
                <li>Assemble the birthdays of your friends and loved ones</li>
                <li>Store your upcoming events</li>
                <li>Tell you some jokes</li>
                <li>Share some random facts with you</li>
                <li>Roll a dice</li>
                <li>Share some motivational quotes</li>

                <h3>LIMITATIONS OF SNOWY</h3>
                <p>
                    Snowy manages to do the most basic chores
                    that can be done by a personal assistant
                    with an Average User Interface, starting
                    from keeping records to doing simple
                    calculations with utmost ease. Moreover, it
                    can also tell some random jokes. But Snowy
                    still lacks the basic emotions, commercial
                    virtual assistants promise to provide.

                </p>
                <p>The limitations of Snowy are as follows:</p>
                <ul class="limitlist">
                    <li>
                        It can neither make any emotional
                        attachment with the user nor take any
                        verbal command from the user.
                        

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Snowy is still not cross-platform, i.e.,
                        interoperability is still limited. 
                        

                    </li>
                    <li>Snowy has got an outdated UI. </li>
                </ul>
